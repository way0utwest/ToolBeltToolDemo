* Simple Talk Demo Database Repo

This is a sample repo of the code in a SimpleTalk database, used for demonstrations from Redgate Software. This is not intended to be a production capable or well modeled database, but a sample on which to experiment.

** Setup
There is a script in the root of this repo that contains a basic set up script for a database. The name is used only for orgnanization in a demo pipeline, hence the "\_5" included in the name.

After running this script, a sample SQL Data Generator project is included to fill this database with some random data.
